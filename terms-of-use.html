        <p class="title"><strong>SECRET Terms of Use</strong></p>
        <p class="date"><em>Date of last revision: March 2022</em></p>
        <p><strong>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE (“TERMS”) CAREFULLY BEFORE USING ANY SECRET PLATFORM.</strong></p>
        <p class="bold">If you live in any of the following countries or regions, additional terms may apply to you and are viewable at the bottom of these Terms. We display the country/region within the Terms when applicable.</p>
        <p>Welcome to the SECRET community!  You are reading these Terms because you are using a SECRET website, digital experience, social media platform, mobile app, wearable technology, or one of our other products or services, all of which are part of SECRET’s Platform (“Platform”).  You may access the Platform through a computer, mobile phone, tablet, console, or other technology, which we refer to here as a “Device”.  Your carrier's normal rates and fees apply to your Device.</p>
        <p>These Terms create a legally binding agreement between you and SECRET and its affiliates (which we may refer to as “SECRET,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) regarding your use of the Platform. Please review our List of Local Entities for the name of the SECRET entity responsible for providing the Platform to you and the appropriate contact information. A few important points:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Our Terms May Change.  Some jurisdictions do not permit unilateral updates or changes to consumer terms, so this paragraph may not apply to you.  [See Canada terms.] We may update these Terms from time to time.  If a material change is made, we will post a notice on the Platform or send you a notification.  Read through any changes, and if you don’t agree to them, please stop using the Platform.  If you continue to use our Platform after we notify you of changes, you will be deemed to have accepted the updated Terms, except to the extent prohibited by applicable law.  </li>
            <li>Terms of Sale.  By making any purchase with us, you also agree to the Terms of Sale that apply in your country or region. [See Hungarian terms.]</li>
            <li>Privacy Policy.  Our Privacy Policy describes the collection and use of personal information on the Platform and applies to your use of the Platform.</li>
            <li>Important Notice for Amateur Athletes.  You are responsible for ensuring that your participation on the Platform does not affect your eligibility as an amateur athlete.  Please check with your amateur athletic association for the rules that apply to you.  SECRET is not responsible or liable for your use of the Platform resulting in your ineligibility as an amateur athlete. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>1. GROUND RULES</strong></p>
        <p><Strong>Eligibility.</Strong>  You are only eligible to use the Platform if you are of legal age in your country/region or if you have consent from your parent or guardian.</p>
        <p><strong>Rules for Registration.</strong>  When you register for an account with us, the following rules apply:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Be True:</strong>  Provide accurate and current registration information.</li>
            <li><strong>Be You:</strong>  Keep your registration personal.  Do not register for more than one SECRET account, register a SECRET account on behalf of someone else, or transfer your account.</li>
            <li><strong>Be Secure:</strong>  Keep your username, password and other login credentials secure and do not allow anyone else to use your account. </li>
            <li><strong>Be Responsible:</strong>  Inform SECRET immediately of any unauthorized use of your SECRET account.  You are responsible for anything that happens through your SECRET account – with or without your permission. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, SECRET IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS OR ACTIVITY THAT RESULTS FROM THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF YOUR ACCOUNT.  </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>2.  OWNERSHIP OF CONTENT</strong></p>
        <p>Except for User Content (defined below), all of the content on our Platform - including text, software, scripts, code, designs, graphics, photos, sounds, music, videos, applications, interactive features, articles, news stories, sketches, animations, stickers, general artwork and other content ("Content") - is owned by SECRET or others we license Content from, and is protected by copyright, trademark, patent and other laws. SECRET reserves all rights not expressly described in these Terms.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All trademarks, service marks and trade names (e.g., the SECRET name and the Swoosh design) are owned, registered and/or licensed by SECRET.  You do not acquire a license or any ownership rights to any trademarks, service marks, or trade names through your access or use of the Platform or Content.</li>
            <li>You agree not to change or delete any ownership notices from materials downloaded or printed from the Platform.</li>
            <li>To the extent SECRET approves the download or use of Content comprised of copyrights or copyrightable works, SECRET grants you a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and revocable license to access and use such copyrights or copyrightable works solely for their intended purpose and solely for as long as SECRET makes such Content generally available to the public. You do not acquire any ownership rights in the Content (including any trademarks or other intellectual property included in the Content), and all such Content is intended for personal, non-commercial use.  SECRET reserves the right to monitor your use and to alter or revoke this license or your access to the Content at any time and for any reason.  SECRET reserves the right to take down any Content in violation of these terms or SECRET’s intellectual property rights.  SECRET allowing you this limited use does not constitute a waiver of any of SECRET’s rights to the Content. </li>
            <li>Outside of the specific usage rights granted to you by SECRET in connection with the Platform, you agree not to use, copy, edit, translate, display, distribute, download, transmit, sell, create derivative works of, or in any way exploit any Content, including User Content (unless it is your own User Content that you legally post on the Platform), without SECRET’s prior written consent. Unauthorized use of the Content may constitute a breach of copyright, trademark or other intellectual property laws and may subject you to criminal or civil charges and penalties.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><Strong>3.  POSTING CONTENT ON THE PLATFORM</Strong></p>
        <p><strong>User Content License.</strong> Some parts of the Platform allow you to post photos, videos, comments, and other content, which we refer to as “User Content.”  SECRET is not responsible for User Content others post to the Platform. User Content is owned by you or whoever created it, but when you post User Content you license it to SECRET as described below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You represent that you have the right to post your User Content, and you grant SECRET a non-exclusive, perpetual, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any of the User Content that you post on or in connection with the Platform, including the likeness of any person that appears in the User Content, or any of the concepts or ideas contained in the User Content, for any purpose, including commercial use, which includes the right to translate, display, reproduce, modify, create derivative works, sublicense, distribute and assign these rights. SECRET may, in its sole discretion, remove any User Content at any time.  </li>
            <li>You understand that deleted User Content may persist in SECRET’s systems and on the Platform to the extent your User Content has been publicly posted or shared with others who have not deleted it, unless you or the relevant individual request deletion or blocking of personal data in accordance with applicable law. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>LICENSE TO USE COMMENTS, FEEDBACK AND IDEAS.  You understand that <span class="underline">any comments, feedback, or ideas you send us are provided on a non-confidential basis and you grant to SECRET a perpetual, worldwide license to use all comments, feedback and ideas</span> you may share with us, without notice, compensation or acknowledgement to you, for any purposes whatsoever, including, but not limited to, developing, manufacturing and marketing products and services and creating, modifying or improving products and services.</p>
        <p><strong>4.  USER CODE OF CONDUCT</strong></p>
        <p>We’re excited to have you contribute to the SECRET community.  Here are a few basic rules:</p>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Be Safe.</strong></li>
            <ul>

                <li>Unless we indicate otherwise, our Platform is a public place.  Do not post personal information to the Platform - yours or anybody else’s.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Personal.</strong></li>

                <li><strong>Be Appropriate.</strong> Respect the community and do not post User Content, link to a website, or do anything that is illegal, misleading, malicious, harassing, inaccurate, discriminatory, or otherwise objectionable or inappropriate or which violates any applicable laws. SECRET has the right to prescreen, monitor, or remove User Content – but we have no obligation to do so.</li>
                <li><strong>Be Yourself.</strong>  Do not impersonate any person or organization, including athletes or SECRET employees.</li>

        <p><strong>6.  PARTNERS ON THE PLATFORM</strong></p>
        <p>From time to time, SECRET may link to or partner with third-party websites, social media platforms, mobile apps, and other products and services (“Third Parties”).  You may be able to connect with these Third Parties through the Platform, but this does not mean SECRET endorses, monitors or has any control over these Third Parties or their activities, which are subject to separate terms of use and privacy policies.  You should carefully review any Third Party’s sites and terms of use and privacy policy. <strong>SECRET is not responsible for the content, policies, or activities of Third Parties and you interact with Third Parties at your own risk.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>7.  IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS</strong></p>
        <p>PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. The Platform may include features that promote physical activity, nutrition or general wellness.  They are for your informational purposes only and are not intended as medical advice or services, or for diagnostic or treatment purposes.  </p>

            <li>Consider the risks involved and consult with your medical professional before engaging in any physical activity. </li>
            <li>Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have viewed on the Platform.</li>

            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>USER INTERACTIONS.</strong>  To the extent allowed by applicable law, we are not responsible for your interactions with other users of the Platform or any damage or harm you may experience because of these interactions. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Be responsible and take precautions when interacting with other users (including users you do not know) on the Platform. Before you meet another person face-to-face, consider investigating, bringing a friend, choosing public locations and letting someone know where you will be.  SECRET is under no obligation to become involved with any user dispute, but may do so at its own discretion.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>WARRANTY DISCLAIMER.  Some jurisdictions do not permit certain limitations or exclusions on liabilities, legal warranties and remedies, so these exclusions and limitations may not apply to you. </strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Platform, Content, and the materials and products on this Platform are provided "AS IS.” We aren’t making any promises of any kind, including about the Platform’s accuracy, adequacy, usefulness, reliability or otherwise. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, SECRET IS NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY USER CONTENT POSTED ON THE PLATFORM.    </li>
            <li>SECRET does not guarantee that the Platform will be uninterrupted or error-free, that any defects will be corrected, or that the Platform is free of viruses or anything else harmful.  </li>
            <li>To the fullest extent permitted by law, SECRET disclaims all warranties, express or implied, regarding the Platform, Content, User Content and any products or services you may obtain or access through the Platform, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>We want you to enjoy our Platform, but SECRET must also protect itself from any damages you may cause.</p>
        <p><Strong>Indemnification and RELEASE.  Some jurisdictions do not permit certain limitations or exclusions on liabilities, legal warranties and remedies, so these exclusions limitations may not apply to you.</Strong> You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless SECRET Inc., its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors and suppliers (the “SECRET Parties”) from and against all claims, losses, liabilities, expenses, damages and costs, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, arising from or relating in any way to your User Content, your use of Content, your use of the Platform, your conduct in connection with the Platform or with other Platform users, or any violation of these Terms of Use, any law or the rights of any third party. You, for yourself and on behalf of your heirs, estate, insurers, successors and assigns, hereby fully and forever release and discharge the SECRET Parties from any and all claims or causes of action you may have for damages relating in any way to your use of the Platform.</p>
        <p><Strong>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  Some jurisdictions do not permit certain limitations or exclusions on liabilities, legal warranties and remedies, so these exclusions/limitations may not apply to you.</Strong>  NONE OF THE SECRET PARTIES WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOST DATA, THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OF, OR THE INABILITY TO USE, THE PLATFORM OR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PRODUCTS PURCHASED THROUGH THE PLATFORM OR THE CONDUCT OF OTHER PLATFORM USERS (WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE), OR ATTENDANCE AT A SECRET EVENT OR SECRET PARTNER EVENTS, OR ANY USER CONTENT OR ANY OTHER ACTIVITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THE PLATFORM, EVEN IF SECRET HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  YOU ASSUME TOTAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR USE OF THE PLATFORM. YOUR ONLY REMEDY AGAINST SECRET IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE PLATFORM OR ANY CONTENT IS TO STOP USING THE PLATFORM.

        <p><strong>10.  DISPUTES / ADDITIONAL TERMS</strong></p>
        <p><Strong>Choice of Law/Jurisdiction</Strong></p>
        <p><strong>If you live in any of the following countries/regions, different “Choice of Law/Jurisdiction” terms may apply to you: </strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>You agree that this Platform is a passive platform solely based in Indonesia, which does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over SECRET in jurisdictions other than Oregon.</li>
            <li>You agree that the Platform, Terms, Privacy Policy and any dispute between you and SECRET shall be governed in all respects by Oregon law, without regard to choice of law provisions, and not by the 1980 U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.</li>
            <li>Except where prohibited by applicable law, and without limitation to any statutory rights for consumers, you agree that all disputes, claims and legal proceedings directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to the Platform (including but not limited to the purchase of SECRET products) shall be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action, and exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Indonesia.</li>
            <li>You consent to waive all defenses of “lack of personal jurisdiction” and “inconvenient forum” with respect to venue and jurisdiction in the state and federal courts of Multnomah County, Oregon.</li>
            <li>All claims shall be brought within one (1) year after the claim arises, except to the extent a longer period is required by applicable law.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><Strong>Electronic Communications</Strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>By using the Platform, you agree to receive certain electronic communications from SECRET, subject to applicable law.</li>
            <li>You agree that any notice, agreement, disclosure or other communication that SECRET sends you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Right to Assign, No Waivers, Severability</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>SECRET may assign its rights and duties under these Terms to any party at any time without notice to you, unless notice to you is required by applicable law, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under these Terms. </li>
            <li>SECRET’s failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of these Terms is not a waiver of any of these Terms or SECRET’s rights. Users should always assume these Terms apply.</li>
            <li>If any provision in these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of these Terms shall continue to be enforceable.</li>
        </ul>
